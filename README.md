# API automation using Spring Boot

## Use of Spring boot in Test Automation
```
1. Cleaner code
2. Easy to maintain dependencies like Selenium, Rest Assured etc..
3. Easy to play around with different environments, files, parallel execution etc..
4. Everything is annotated.
```

## SpringBoot Application Context
```
It represents the Spring IoC container and is responsible for instantiating, configuring, and assembling the beans. 
The container gets its instructions on what objects to instantiate, configure, and assemble by reading configuration metadata. 
The configuration metadata is represented in XML, Java annotations, or Java code.
```

## Dependency Injection (Commonly used)
```
1. Constructor injection
2. Field injection
3. Setter injection
```
